## Tire Mold Quality (Goodyear)  

A project conducted in 2017 to understand the variability of different tire molds in a particular manufacturing plant. General approach was to simulate the quality results of tires coming from 4 separate models to test hypotheses around the effectiveness of a questionable process change. Data source was abstracted to protect IP. Deliverables included visualizations (control chart and histograms) of quality metrics by mold machine ID.

A congressional candidate, who was an advocate for affordable medications, raised awareness by running 100 miles from a part of Ohio to Columbus to deliver a petition to the State Capitol. To help increase coverage, I built a stochastic simulation to predict the arrival times of certain areas for local news to find the candidate. Results were within 5 minutes of the actual area arrival time until mile 65 where an unexpected road detour added additional time and distance. Re-running the analysis at the time of hearing about the detour, was able to predict a final State Capitol arrival within 20 minutes of actual arrival.
