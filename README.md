# Simulations

## Rando Slice.py...
...was a stochastic simulation built to see the sensistivity of a specific output when randomly selected assets were chosen for a certain type of analysis. Being vague here since it was for a professional project. 10,000 iterations were used to analyze the output.

## Simulation.py...
... was built to estimate the time of arrival of an ultra-marathon runner in various towns along the route in order to best inform local media for coverage. Analysis held up until mile 67, but being total accurate was not necessarily the point here. The runner was performing his run in order to raise awareness of the rising cost of insulion for diabetic patients. Citizen engagement was the main goal.
